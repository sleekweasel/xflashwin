A terminal program I use should implement visual bell, but it's broken on my Linux machine.

It can run a program when the bell should sound, so I run this xflashwin twice in a
shell script with a 'sleep 0.05' in the middle.

I'd prefer xflashwin to do the dual inversion, but I know very little X11 and don't have
the time to explore at work.

build (and test) with ./build.sh
